# College Placement Management System

## Project Documentation

### Skill Development Web Application Project

---

## 1. Introduction

The **College Placement Management System** is a web-based application developed as part of the Skill Development Lab. The system is designed to simplify and organize the college placement process by providing a centralized platform for students and placement administrators.

The application allows students to view available placement opportunities, check their eligibility, apply for placement drives, and track their application status. Administrators can manage students, companies, placement drives, eligibility criteria, and applications.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Traditional college placement processes often involve manual records, spreadsheets, notices, and multiple communication channels. This can make it difficult to maintain student information, manage company details, check eligibility, and track applications.

The proposed system provides a centralized web application that reduces manual work and makes the placement process easier to manage.

* To provide eligibility information for placement drives.
* To allow eligible students to apply for companies.
* To track student application and selection status.
* To simplify placement management for administrators.
* To reduce manual record keeping.
